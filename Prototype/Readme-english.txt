In the main menu there are two buttons in the upper left that simulate the user to receive a friend request (if accepted the button disappears).


When trying to add friends, the teacher will be asked to choose which group of people (buttons)
- Each group has 4 different people and it is always possible to click on any of the buttons
- Groups represent people within a 10-meter radius (displayed in order of distance)

- The request is automatically accepted the second time the teacher is on the friends main screen ('friendsHub.html')


If the lock button (upper right) is pressed, the clock display will turn off, after a new touch it will turn on when the unlock screen appears. After being unlocked back to the page where it was
- The unlock screen includes:
  - Current hours (upper left corner)
  - How long to arrive for the next drone (upper right corner)
  - Next activity added to the center

- There are three buttons in the upper left corner to define whether we are on the first, second or third day of the festival (change the activity to be shown)


After purchasing an item after 5 minutes a warning message will be displayed on whatever screen the user is on (except the lock)


If for some reason if you want to reset the clock data (drones, friends, acctivities) simply reopen index.html
